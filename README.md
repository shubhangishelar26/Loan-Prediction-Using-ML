1.Logistic Regression accuracy:  0.8098159509202454

2.SVM accuracy: 0.7116564417177914

3.Decision Tree accuracy:  0.7300613496932515

4.KNN accuracy:  0.6441717791411042

Based on these results, we can draw some conclusions:

Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy score of approximately 0.81, which is the highest among the four models. This indicates that the LR model performed well in classifying the test instances and is the most accurate model in this case.

SVM achieved an accuracy score of approximately 0.71, which is lower than the accuracy of Logistic Regression. While SVM did not perform as well as LR, it still showed reasonable performance in classifying the test data.

Decision Tree achieved an accuracy score of approximately 0.73, which is higher than the accuracy of SVM but lower than that of Logistic Regression. This suggests that Decision Tree was able to capture some patterns in the data and performed moderately well.

KNN achieved an accuracy score of approximately 0.64, which is the lowest among the four models. This indicates that KNN may not have been the best choice for this particular dataset, as it did not perform as well in classifying the test instances.
